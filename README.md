*** my kernel. *** \
Hello world. I am Akiho Suzuha and I am a priest in a temple without a god. My personal computer is my temple. I am writing opcodes on walls of my temple. It's saint ritual. \
My mission is create new programming language and write kernel on it, that woud be smaller, easier to modify and faster than linux.\
